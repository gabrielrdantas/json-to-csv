The format has gained popularity on web services such as email clients and shopping sites as it is able to transmit checker formatter a large amount of information between the client and server using a smaller amount of characters. checker Value and attribute pairs are separated by: and their values, when text, are enclosed in quotation marks (numbers, for example, do not fit as quotation marks checker formatter).This pair-set logic can be repeated over and over, creating multiple levels for the desired data structure.In practice, .json is a format that contains a series of data structured in text and is used to transfer information between systems.The data contained in a JSON format file must be structured through a collection of name and value pairs checker formatter or be an ordered list of values.• value: represents the corresponding content and can contain the following data types: string, array, object, number, boolean or null.Data transfer between applications is done through checker formatter API - Application Programming Interface - which, among other formats, uses a JSON notation to structure the transferred information.JSON format is also used to perform AJAX requests on websites, in which different interactions are made with the database, such as MySql, to perform operations such as query, inclusion and exclusion of records.Node.js, for example, uses a file called package.json in its projects to store the dependencies used in the application.Files in .json format make the specific features that make this specification more attractive to use in applications that consume data from other systems.The simplicity with which the data is structured in JSON format allows it to be used in any kind of programming language.File Formatting In addition to the .json ending in all files that use this format, the stored data must follow a specific notation, that is, it needs to be organized with the following basic elements: • curly braces  to delimit objects and mandatory to start and terminate the content;It is also suitable for use in mobile applications, where you need to request data from a server and quickly use it in the application.JSON format is easy to use, as its notification even allows a visual understanding of the data organization.Faster execution and data transport Storing data in text format, by the way, allows the .json file to take up little memory space.This feature checker formatter offers great performance, as it is small, occupies few bytes, which offers more agility for downloading and loading during processing checker formatter.</p></article><div class="sc-kDTinF eXcjTU"><h4 class="sc-crHmcD cWkXqL">Related Links</h4><ul class="sc-iqseJM ircGJv"><li class="sc-bqiRlB DaYUw"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertto-json?view=powershell-7.2" class="sc-egiyK cjpTIL">ConvertTo-Json</a></li></ul></div></section>
